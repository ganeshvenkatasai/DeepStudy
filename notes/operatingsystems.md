# Operating Systems

## OS Fundamentals
### Basic Concepts
- `Operating System` → Manages hardware/software resources  
- `Kernel` → Core component managing system operations  
- `Shell` → User interface to access OS services  
- `System Calls` → Interface between programs and OS  

## Process Management
### Process Concepts
- `Process` → Program in execution  
- `PCB` → Process Control Block (stores process state)  
- `Process States` → New, Ready, Running, Waiting, Terminated  
- `Context Switch` → Saving/restoring process state  

### Scheduling
- `FCFS` → First-Come, First-Served  
- `SJF` → Shortest Job First  
- `Round Robin` → Time-sliced scheduling  
- `Priority` → Based on process priority  
- `Multilevel Queue` → Multiple priority queues  

### Threads
- `Thread` → Lightweight process within a process  
- `User Threads` → Managed by user-level library  
- `Kernel Threads` → Managed by OS kernel  
- `Multithreading` → Multiple threads per process  

## Memory Management
### Basic Concepts
- `Logical Address` → Generated by CPU  
- `Physical Address` → Actual memory location  
- `MMU` → Memory Management Unit (address translation)  

### Techniques
- `Paging` → Fixed-size blocks (pages/frames)  
- `Segmentation` → Variable-size logical divisions  
- `Virtual Memory` → Illusion of large memory  
- `Page Replacement` → FIFO, LRU, Optimal algorithms  

## Storage Management
### File Systems
- `File` → Named collection of related information  
- `Directory` → Organizes files hierarchically  
- `File Operations` → Create, Open, Read, Write, Delete  
- `Allocation Methods` → Contiguous, Linked, Indexed  

### Disk Management
- `Disk Scheduling` → FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN  
- `RAID` → Redundant Array of Independent Disks  

## CPU Architecture
- `Registers` → Fast CPU storage locations  
- `Cache` → Fast memory between CPU and RAM  
- `Pipeline` → Parallel instruction execution  
- `Interrupts` → Signals to CPU for attention  

## Concurrency
### Synchronization
- `Race Condition` → Unpredictable outcome from concurrent access  
- `Critical Section` → Code accessing shared resources  
- `Mutex` → Mutual exclusion lock  
- `Semaphore` → Signaling mechanism  
- `Deadlock` → Circular wait for resources  

### Deadlock Handling
- `Prevention` → Design system to avoid deadlocks  
- `Avoidance` → Banker's Algorithm  
- `Detection/Recovery` → Identify and resolve deadlocks  

## Protection & Security
- `Authentication` → Verifying user identity  
- `Authorization` → Access control permissions  
- `Encryption` → Data protection  
- `Malware` → Viruses, Worms, Trojans  

## Linux/Unix Basics
### Commands
- `ls` → List directory contents  
- `grep` → Search text patterns  
- `chmod` → Change file permissions  
- `ps` → Display running processes  
- `kill` → Terminate processes  

### Concepts
- `Inode` → Metadata about files  
- `Fork` → Create child process  
- `Pipe` → Inter-process communication  

## Virtualization
- `Hypervisor` → Creates/runs virtual machines  
- `Type 1` → Bare-metal hypervisor (VMware ESXi)  
- `Type 2` → Hosted hypervisor (VirtualBox)  
- `Containers` → Lightweight virtualization (Docker)  

## Distributed Systems
- `Client-Server` → Centralized service model  
- `Peer-to-Peer` → Decentralized network  
- `Load Balancing` → Distributes work across systems  
- `CAP Theorem` → Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance  

## Performance Metrics
- `Throughput` → Work completed per time unit  
- `Turnaround Time` → Total execution time  
- `Waiting Time` → Time spent in ready queue  
- `Response Time` → Time to first response
